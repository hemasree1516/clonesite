# My Framer Site

This project was initially created using [Framer](https://same-course-801338.framer.app/), a no-code visual design tool for building interactive websites. After designing the base structure in Framer, the site was exported and converted into HTML, React, and CSS.

Additional interactive effects and styling enhancements—those not feasible directly within Framer—were added manually to ensure better performance and flexibility for future customization.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### 1. Clone or Download

Download the exported `.html` and associated assets from Framer.

Place them all in one folder, for example:

```

project-folder/
│
├── index.html
├── assets/
└── other files...

```

### 2. Open with Browser

Simply double-click on `index.html`, or right-click and choose:

```

Open with → Chrome / Firefox / Edge

````

### 3. Local Server (Optional)

To serve the project using a local server (useful for JS/CSS loading):

- **Using VS Code with Live Server:**
  1. Install the **Live Server** extension.
  2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

- **Using Python:**

```bash
# For Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000
````

Then open: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* React (used selectively for interactivity)
* JavaScript
* Fonts: Inter, Poppins, Satoshi, Outfit (loaded via CDN)

## 📦 Note

Framer-exported sites are static and rely heavily on Framer's CDN. Ensure you are online for the site to render correctly. The enhancements made after export help extend the possibilities of the base Framer design.
